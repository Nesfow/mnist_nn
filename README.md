# mnist_nn
Two ways of making neural network for recognition of hand-written figures.

First, NN made with Tensorflow.
Second, made mainly with numpy during studying by the book "Make your own neural network" by T. Rashid

!IMPORTANT!
Training has been done with full dataset, but it exceeds 100 MB, so it was zipped.
Full MNIST dataset stored in .csv format should be unzipped.
Also, small datasets with 10 test and 100 train samples were added.
